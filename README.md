# plot.ly-challenge

This was an interesting challenge. I had trouble reading the data from a subdirectory, unfortunatley this didn't work. I tried declaring the data set in the samples.js file, but couldn't really get this to work either. I ended up sticking it in the primary and calling it in a function. I used d3 to pull in the data from the samples, and then plot.ly to make some plots. 

The gauge chart took the longest to recreate, but I did get it functioning well.
